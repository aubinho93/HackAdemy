## Overview 
The XSS attack is an attack realized when submit from end user is interpretted by a browser.
It is classified among injection attacks.  Early on it was categorized as three kinds, stored, DOM based and reflected. 
> These three types are defined as follows :

>> + __Stored XSS__: generally occurs when server stocks submitted data from one user and then this data could be seen by others users : in a message log, in user log, in user credentials, in message form, in user cv.

>> + __Reflected XSS__ : when the user supplied data is automatically replied to the same user without escapping from the server. 

>> + __DOM based XSS__ : when the user input isn't send to the server but is used to automatically update it's DOM.

>This classification was quickly deprecated. To clarify it, the research community proposed two new terms to help organize the types of XSS that can occur :

>> + Server XSS
>> + Client XSS

### Server XSS 
---
Server Xss occurs when untrusted data from user is replied with server gnerated HTML data. n this case, the entire vulnerability is in server-side code, and the browser is simply rendering the response and executing any valid script embedded in it.

### Client XSS
----
Client XSS occurs when untrusted data is used to update the dom with an unsafe call of client side script. 

## How to test for XSS 
+ Graybox test is the best way to test for XSS, each http data input could possibly be a XSS attack vector if the input is not escapped. 

+ The best way to perform black blackbox test in server XSS is to use proxy, dirbust the website detect all submitted data to the server and injects some HTML characters and analyse server response.
